          <h3>To Eric, the cutest little deer on the island.</h3>
          <p>
            You are the third villager who move to my island, and I see that
            your original home was an ice house, like Santa's reindeer's hut.
            But because of living on my island, you now live in a simple cork
            house. You are to me the reindeer that Nintendo gave me with the
            blessings of Santa. Quietly fishing on the island, catching bugs,
            and occasionally writing me those words that make me warm, and
            giving me the gift your mother gave you again. You are like the
            anchor of the island, I can always feel peace and warmth in you.
            <br /><br />
            Let's meet again in our dreams

        <h3>For my permanent residents Teddy,</h3>
        <p>
          You are one of the first two villager who come to my island, and
          you've been seeing my island build from nothing to everything. Every
          time you send me a letter, I can feel full of your style that belongs
          to you. I can see a you who is always in motion and can feel the you
          who is always full of power. You always write to remind me to exercise
          more, but the only way I can communicate with you is to turn on the
          switch and play games to find you. Every time I get a letter from you,
          I run a few more laps around my island and have a sense of
          self-delusion about exercise. Hopefully in 2021, I'll be able to
          exercise more in reality, and then you'll have to do the same! One day
          you will have your own muscles too ðŸ’ª
          <br /><br />
          Love you Jialin

        <p>
          Hello ah, think when I went to the outer island through dodo air, by
          chance met you, your two big eyes looking at me when I could not bear
          to abandon you on the island, so I picked you up. You have amazing
          perseverance, and every time you write, you talk to me about the way
          to exercise and tell me to stick to it. You wrote in your letter that
          your muscles were as strong as an athlete's, and that it would be nice
          when I could really touch your tummy.
          <br /><br />
          Maybe I will run with you on the island in the future, Jialin

          This letter is addressed to you, and it's full of my thanks for the
          Valentine's Day chocolates you sent me! It's possible that my
          enthusiasm has melted a little! But you don't mind it! One day I will
          also send you a chocolate like taste to your heart.

          normally. Tia, thank you for taking care of me. I will come to your

        <h3>To Raymond,</h3>
        <p>
          I see in you the coexistence of narcissism and self-confidence. You
          would often write to me in a boyfriend way, giving me the illusion of
          being in love. You said you wanted to be frank about your feelings,
          and although you wrote to me, you wrote in your letters that you
          wished to see me immediately. How can you be so sweet.
          <br /><br />
          Hope to see you in real life

        <p>
          The first time you wrote to me you sent me a piece of art, which
          really surprised me. Now I've donated him to the museum, and I hope
          that every time you see the art in the museum you'll remember that it
          was donated by us together!

        <h3>To my life coach Kabuki.</h3>
        <p>
          I still remember the time you wrote to me just when I was at a loss, a
          time when I was unsatisfied with my homework and losing money in the
          stock market. It seemed that every morning when I woke up, I just
          wanted to close my eyes again and live from day to day. This time I
          opened the animal crossing I hadn't played in a long time and received
          your letter to me. In this letter you said that life is inevitably
          through the big storm, we all hope that good scenery will last, but in
          the low period, keep a cheerful mind, one day will become the object
          of others longing. This letter immediately touched me, as if it helped
          me to clear the clouds, seemingly a simple letter, but gave me the
          motivation to continue to try to live on. Let's work together for the
          next days!
          <br /><br />
          I will keep trying to live my life, Jialin.

          All your letters to me are about food, and every time I receive your
          letters, I especially want to eat the food you describe. I hope you
          also in the near future we will eat food together. Although you have
          left my island, I hope you find the next beautiful island in the vast
          ocean of data. Then continue to enjoy your good food.

          Your letters always heal me, it's really very warm to receive your

          not. Thank you. Although you have left my island, I hope that one day
