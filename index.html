          <h3>To Eric, the cutest little deer on the island.</h3>
          <p>
            You are the third villager who move to my island, and I see that
            your original home was an ice house, like Santa's reindeer's hut.
            But because of living on my island, you now live in a simple cork
            house. You are to me the reindeer that Nintendo gave me with the
            blessings of Santa. Quietly fishing on the island, catching bugs,
            and occasionally writing me those words that make me warm, and
            giving me the gift your mother gave you again. You are like the
            anchor of the island, I can always feel peace and warmth in you.
            <br><br>
            Let's meet again in our dreams
            <br><br>

          <h3>For my permanent residents Teddy,</h3>
          <p>
            You are one of the first two villager who come to my island, and you've been seeing my island build from nothing to everything. Every time you send me a letter, I can feel full of your style that belongs to you. I can see a you who is always in motion and can feel the you who is always full of power. You always write to remind me to exercise more, but the only way I can communicate with you is to turn on the switch and play games to find you. Every time I get a letter from you, I run a few more laps around my island and have a sense of self-delusion about exercise. Hopefully in 2021, I'll be able to exercise more in reality, and then you'll have to do the same! One day you will have your own muscles too ðŸ’ª
            <br><br>
            Love you Jialin
